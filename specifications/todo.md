update react to react 19 for Suspense

add map details into store in phase 1

split phase 2 into input list, and map interactivity 

flesh out phase 1, including files to be created, and background info that only includes overarching project objective + technical details that are only relevant to phase one


flesh out phase 1 more to define the function signatures, docstrings, component props, store

plan out step by step what commands/installation, which file should be created first using bottom up approach
